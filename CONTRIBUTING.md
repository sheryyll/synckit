**Recommended:**
- VS Code with Rust Analyzer extension
- PostgreSQL (for server development)

### Setup Instructions

```bash
# 1. Fork the repository on GitHub
#    Click "Fork" button on https://github.com/Dancode-188/synckit

# 2. Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/synckit.git
cd synckit

# 3. Add upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/Dancode-188/synckit.git

# 4. Install dependencies
npm install  # Installs SDK and example workspaces
# or
bun install

# 5. Install server dependencies (not a workspace)
cd server/typescript
bun install
cd ../..

# 6. Build the core (WASM) - Optional, pre-built WASM included
# Only needed if modifying Rust code
cd core
bash scripts/build-wasm.sh  # or scripts/build-wasm.ps1 on Windows
cd ..

# 7. Build the SDK
npm run build

# 8. Verify setup
npm test
```

### Verify Setup

```bash
# Run all tests (core + SDK + server)
npm test

# Or run specific test suites:
npm test -w sdk              # SDK tests only
cd core && cargo test         # Core Rust tests
cd server/typescript && bun test  # Server tests

# Run linter
npm run lint

# Type check
npm run type-check
```

## Development Workflow

### Branch Naming

Use descriptive branch names:

```bash
# Features
feature/add-vue-adapter
feature/sqlite-storage

```

### Development Process

```bash
# 1. Sync with upstream
git fetch upstream
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main

# 2. Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# 4. Run tests
npm test

# 5. Run linter
npm run lint

# 6. Commit changes (see commit conventions below)
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add Vue adapter"

# 7. Push to your fork
git push origin feature/your-feature-name

# 8. Open pull request on GitHub
```

## Style Guidelines

### TypeScript Style

```typescript
// ✅ Good
export async function updateDocument<T>(
  id: string,
  updates: Partial<T>
): Promise<void> {
  const doc = sync.document<T>(id)
  await doc.update(updates)
}

// ❌ Bad
export async function updateDocument(id, updates) {
  var doc = sync.document(id)
  await doc.update(updates)
}
```

**Rules:**
- Use `const` and `let`, never `var`
- Explicit types for function parameters and returns
- Use async/await over promises
- Use arrow functions for callbacks
- Use template literals for strings

### Rust Style

```rust
// ✅ Good
pub fn merge_documents(
    local: &Document,
    remote: &Document,
) -> Result<Document, MergeError> {
    let merged = Document::new();
    // ...
    Ok(merged)
}

// ❌ Bad
pub fn merge_documents(local: &Document, remote: &Document) -> Document {
    let mut merged = Document::new();
    // ...
    merged
}
```

**Rules:**
- Follow `rustfmt` defaults
- Use `Result<T, E>` for errors
- Document public APIs with `///`
- Keep functions small (<50 lines)

### Documentation Style

```markdown
<!-- ✅ Good -->
## Quick Start

Install SyncKit:

```bash
npm install @synckit/sdk
```

Initialize in your app:

```typescript
const sync = new SyncKit()
const doc = sync.document<Todo>('todo-1')
```

<!-- ❌ Bad -->
## quick start

install it
npm install @synckit/sdk

then use it
const sync = new SyncKit()
```

**Rules:**
- Use proper markdown formatting
- Include code examples
- Use headers for structure
- Keep paragraphs short (<4 lines)
