- **Performance Benchmarks** - Operation latency, throughput, memory usage

#### Documentation
- **User Guides** (5 comprehensive guides)
  - Getting Started (5-minute quick start)
  - Offline-First Patterns (IndexedDB, sync strategies)
  - Conflict Resolution (LWW, custom handlers)
  - Performance Optimization (bundle size, memory, Web Workers)
  - Testing Guide (property-based tests, chaos engineering)
- **Migration Guides** (3 detailed guides)
  - From Firebase/Firestore (escape vendor lock-in)

### Performance

- **Local Operations:** <1ms (371ns single field update, 74µs document merge)
- **Sync Latency:** <100ms p95 (achieving 10-50ms in practice)
- **Bundle Size:** ~53KB gzipped total (49KB WASM + ~4KB SDK, default variant with all features), ~48KB gzipped total (44KB WASM + ~4KB SDK, lite variant, local-only)
- **Memory Usage:** ~3MB for 10K documents
- **Test Coverage:** 385 comprehensive tests across all layers

### Quality & Verification

- **v1.0.0:** Stable API, production-ready for enterprise

### Breaking Changes

Breaking changes will be:
- ⚠️ Clearly marked with **BREAKING** in changelog
- 📢 Announced in release notes
- 🔄 Documented with migration guide
- ⏰ Deprecated for at least one minor version before removal

## Upgrade Guide

### From Pre-Release to v0.1.0

If you were using SyncKit during development (Phases 1-8):

```typescript
// No breaking changes! API is stable
const sync = new SyncKit()
const doc = sync.document<Todo>('todo-1')
await doc.update({ completed: true })
```

### Future Upgrades

Migration guides will be provided for all breaking changes in future versions.
